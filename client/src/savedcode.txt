    [['Earthquakes\nThey result from the rupture of rocks along a fault.\n\nEnergy from an earthquake is released in the form of seismic waves.\n\nThey are mapped according to the epicentre; the focus is located directly below the epicentre.\n\nThey are measured by \nseismographs and compared \nby magnitude.', 'Earthquake Magnitude\nThe magnitude of an earthquake is expressed as a number to one decimal place.\n\nThis type of measurement was first developed by seismologist Charles Richter in 1935\n\nThe Richter Scale was a measure of the strength of a wave 100 km from the epicentre.\n\nSince then, more accurate methods have been developed and the Richter Scale is no longer in use', 'The Moment Magnitude Scale\nToday, earthquakes are compared using the Moment Magnitude scale (M).\n\nThe scale is determined by:\nThe area of rock ruptured along a fault\nThe distance of movement along the fault \nThe elasticity of the rock at the focus\nLike the Richter Scale, it is a logarithmic scale.\n\nExample: an M7 earth quake represent 10 times the strength of an M6 earthquake', 'Magnitude and Frequency of Earthquakes\nThere is no official upper limit on the Moment Magnitude Scale.\n\nThe strongest earthquake ever recorded on the scale is M9.5 in Chile in 1960.  In Canada, it is M8.1 in B.C. in 1949.\n\nThere are only a few M9+\n earthquakes each century', 'The Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale\nThis is a qualitative scale based on damage to property and the effect of an earthquake on people.', 'Earthquake Processes\nEarthquakes are most common at or near plate boundaries.\n\nMotion at plate boundaries is not smooth or constant.\nFriction along plate boundaries exerts a force (stress) on the rocks, exerting strain or deformation\n\nWhen the stress exceeds the strength of the rocks, there is a sudden movement along a fault.', 'Earthquake Processes\nThe rupture starts at the focus and propagates in all directions in the form of seismic waves.\n\nThus, faults are considered seismic sources.\nIdentifying faults is necessary to evaluate the risk of an earthquake in an area\nNot all faults are down at the earth’s surface. Blind faults are located below the surface', 'Earthquake Distribution', 'Fault Types\nThere are two basic types of geologic faults; they are distinguished by the direction of the displacement of rock.\n\nStrike-slip faults\nDisplacements are horizontal\n\nDip-slip faults\nDisplacements are vertical', 'Strike-Slip Faults\nThe San Andreas Fault is the best example of this type.', 'Dip-Slip Faults\nThere are three categories:\nReverse faults, thrust faults, and normal faults\n\nThey are comprised of two inclined walls, as defined by miners:\nFootwall (where miners placed their feet)\nHanging-wall (where miners placed their lanterns)', 'Dip-Slip Faults', 'Dip-Slip Faults\nReverse Fault:\nThe hanging wall has moved up relative to the footwall and is inclined at an angle above 45 degrees\n\nThrust Fault:\nThese are like reverse faults except the angle is 45 degrees or less\n\nNormal Fault:\nThe hanging wall has moved down relative to the footwall', 'Dip-Slip Faults', 'Fault Activity\nIn terms of activity, faults can fall into one of three categories:\n\nActive\nMovement during the past 11,600 years\n\nPotentially Active\nMovement during the past 2.6 million years\n\nInactive\nNo movement during the past 2.6 million years', 'Tectonic Creep\nDefinition:\nThe extremely slow movement of rock along a fracture caused by stress\n\nIt is also referred to as fault creep.\n\nThis can damage roads and building foundations (movement of a few cm per decade).\nAlong these faults, periodic sudden displacements producing earthquakes can occur', 'Seismic Waves\nSome seismic waves generated by fault rupture travel within the body of the Earth and others travel along the surface.\n\nBody waves:\nThese include P waves and S waves\nP waves: they are also called primary or compressional waves\n\nThey move relatively fast with a push pull motion and can travel through solids or liquids', 'Seismic Waves\nS waves\nThey are also called secondary or shear waves.\nThey move relatively slow, in an up-and-down motion and can only travel through solid rock', 'Seismic Waves\n   \t    P waves\t\t\t\tS waves', 'Surface Waves\nDefinition:\nSeismic waves that form when P waves and S waves reach Earth’s surface and then move along it\n\nThese waves move more slowly than body waves.\n\nSurface waves are responsible for damage near the epicenter', 'Earthquake Shaking\nFactors that determine the shaking that people experience during an earthquake:\nMagnitude\nDistance to the epicenter\nFocus depth\nDirection of rupture\nLocal soil and rock type\nLocal engineering and construction practices', 'Earthquake Shaking\nSeismographs record the arrival of waves to a recording station.\nBecause P waves travel faster than S waves, they appear first on a seismograph\n\nEarthquake shaking decreases with distance from the epicenter', 'Distance to the Epicentre\nThe difference between the arrival times of the P waves and S waves at different locations determine the distance to the epicentre.\nThe distance to the epicenter is calculated at 3 different seismic stations\n\nA circle with radius equal to that distance is drawn around the station', 'Locating an Earthquake\nThe epicentre is located where the circles intersect; this process is called triangulation.', 'Focus Depth\nSeismic waves become less intense as they spread outward toward the surface.\n\nTherefore, the greater the focus depth, the less intense the shaking at the surface', 'Direction of Rupture\nEarthquake energy is more focused along the geographic direction of rupture.\n\nThis is known as directivity and contributes to increased shaking.  \n\nRadiated waves are sometimes stronger along the direction of the fault.', 'Local Soil and Rock Type\nThe local geology influences the amount of ground motion.\nDense homogeneous crust can transmit earthquake energy quickly\n\nSeismic energy slows down in areas with heterogeneous, folded, faulted crust.\n\nImplication:\nEarthquakes in eastern North America are felt over larger areas than those in western North America', 'Shaking by Region\nThe underlying bedrock in eastern North America is more homogeneous than in the west.', 'Amplification\nDefinition:\nAn increase in ground motion during an earthquake\n\nP waves and S waves slow down as they travel through alluvial sand, gravel, clay, soil, etc.\n\nAs the waves slow some of their energy is transferred to surface waves', 'Amplification\nAmplification has historically enhanced damage in San Francisco area earthquakes.', 'Shake Maps\nThe combination of all these effects results in widespread variation of the shaking felt in the vicinity of an earthquake.  \n\nTherefore, two earthquakes that have the same magnitude can have very different impacts', 'The Earthquake Cycle\nDefinition:\nA hypothesis that explains successive earthquakes on a fault over time\n\nIt is based on the idea that strain drops abruptly after an earthquake and then slowly accumulates until the next earthquake.\nAs stress continues to increase, the deformed rocks will eventually rupture', 'The Earthquake Cycle', 'The Earthquake Cycle\nA typical cycle has several stages:\n\n- an inactive period\nA period where strain produces minor earthquakes\nA period of foreshocks prior to a major release of stress (this stage does not always occur)\n\nA foreshock is a small to moderate earthquake that occurs shortly before and in the same general area as the mainshock\nMainshock: largest earthquake in a series of associated earthquakes', 'The Earthquake Cycle\n- a period where the mainshock occurs allowing the fault to release built-up stress\nAftershock: small to moderate earthquake that occurs shortly after and in the same general area as the mainshock\n\n\nThe time between each stage varies.', 'Aftershocks', 'Geographic Regions at                                  Risk from Earthquakes\nEarthquakes are not randomly distributed.\n\nMost earthquakes occur along plate boundaries: \n\nPacific Ring of Fire, Himalaya Mountains, Middle East\n\nNorth American cities at high risk of earthquakes:\nAnchorage, Vancouver, Victoria, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Mexico City\nHowever, not all areas at risk of earthquakes are near plate boundaries.', 'Earthquakes in Canada', 'Plate Boundary Earthquakes\nDefinition:\nEarthquakes that occur on faults which specifically separate plates\n\n\nThere are three types:\nStrike-slip earthquakes\nThrust earthquakes\nNormal fault earthquakes', 'Strike-Slip Earthquakes\nThese earthquakes occur along transform faults where plates slide horizontally past one another.\n\nThey are common in California along the San Andreas fault\n\nThe best-known strike-slip earthquake is the Loma Prieta earthquake that disrupted the 1989 World Series in Oakland, California.', 'Thrust Earthquakes\nThese earthquakes occur on faults that separate converging plates.\n\nThey are also called subduction earthquakes.\nThey are common off the coast of B.C., Washington, and Oregon\n\nThese earthquakes are the strongest on Earth (some are larger than M9) and can produce tsunamis', 'Normal Fault Earthquakes\nThese earthquakes occur on faults associated with divergent plate boundaries.\n\nThey are common along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge\n\nMost are located under oceans and are generally smaller than M6', 'Intraplate Earthquakes\nDefinition:\nAn earthquake on a fault in the interior of a continent, far from a plate boundary\n\nThese earthquakes are typically not as strong as plate boundary earthquakes.\n\nHowever, damage could be considerable due to lack of preparedness', 'Intraplate Earthquakes\nBecause of dense continental bedrock, these earthquakes are felt over large areas.\n\nThere are two relatively active intraplate zones in North America: Central Mississippi River Valley and St. Lawrence River Valley\n\nThe New Madrid earthquakes in Missouri (1811-12) were over M7.5 and felt across the entire continent.\nRecurrence Interval: time between successive events\nThe recurrence interval in this area is likely several hundred years', 'Earthquake Hazard Map', 'Effects of Earthquakes\nSeveral effects related to earthquakes contribute to deaths and property destruction.\n\nPrimary effects:\nGround shaking, surface rupture\nSecondary effects:\nLiquefaction, land-level change, landslides, fire, tsunamis', 'Surface Rupture\nDisplacement along faults causes cracks in the surface.\nDuring a strong earthquake, fault scarps can be produced that extend for hundreds of kilometers\nFault Scarp: a linear escarpment at Earth’s surface formed by movement along a fault during a an earthquake', 'Surface Rupture\nSurface rupture can uproot trees, collapse buildings, and destroy bridges, tunnels, and pipelines.', 'Liquefaction\nDefinition:\nThe transformation of water-saturated sediment from solid to liquid during an earthquake\n\nIt occurs when water pressure becomes high enough to suspend particles of sediment within the soil.\nOnce the pressure decreases, the sediment compacts and regains its strength', 'Liquefaction\nWatery sand and silt may flow upward along fractures in the overlying rock creating small mounds.\n\nThis effect can cause extensive damage.', 'Landslides\nGround shaking produced by an earthquake can cause rock and sediment to move downslope.\n A single earthquake in a mountainous area can cause thousands of landslides', 'Fires\nGround shaking and rupture can start fires by severing power and gas lines.\n\nAppliances may topple over causing gas leaks that may ignite\n\nApproximately 80% of the damage during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was caused by fire', 'Natural Service Functions of Earthquakes\nFaults provide pathways for the downward flow of surface water.  \nThey can channel groundwater to surface discharge points (springs)\nNew mineral resources can be exposed; some minerals are preferentially deposited in faults\n\nScenic landscapes (hills, valleys) develop in fault zones over millions of years.', 'Earthquakes Caused by                   Human Activity\nSeveral human activities are known to trigger small to moderate earthquakes.\nThe weight from water reservoirs produced by dams can create new faults\n\nInjecting liquid waste deep in the earth can increase pressure and cause slippage along fractures\n\n\nTesting nuclear weapons leads to explosions that may increase strain in an area.', 'Minimizing the Earthquake Hazard\nEarthquakes cause death and destruction because they often occur with little warning.\n\nAt present, we can forecast the likelihood that an earthquake will occur in an area, but not precisely when it will occur.\n\nThe Geological Surveys of Canada and the U.S. have developed programs to reduce the hazard from earthquakes', 'Earthquake Hazard Reduction \x0bPrograms\nThe programs have five goals:\n\n- improve national seismograph networks\n- develop awareness of earthquake sources\n- determine earthquake potential\n- predict effect of earthquakes on buildings\n- communicate research to educate the public', 'Planning for Earthquakes\nThe Denali earthquake in Alaska in 2002 demonstrated the value of planning for earthquakes\n\nWhere the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline crossed the Denali fault, its construction was altered to withstand a large earthquake.', 'Estimating        Seismic Risk\nHazard maps identify areas of risk associated with earthquake effects.\n\nThey include areas prone to liquefaction, zones of potential ground rupture, and historic epicenters', 'Precursors to Earthquakes \nIf higher accuracy forecasts become possible, they will most likely be based on precursors:\n\n1. The pattern and frequency of smaller ruptures\n- based on foreshocks and microearthquakes\n\n2. Land-level change\n- uplift or subsidence may precede earthquakes\n- GPS can recognize small changes in elevation', 'Precursors to Earthquakes\n3. Seismic gaps along faults\n- areas along a fault that have not seen recent earthquakes may be more likely to experience one\n\n\n4. Physical and chemical changes\n- changes in groundwater level and chemistry may occur if rocks expand prior to an earthquake', 'Earthquake Forecasting\nThere have been modest incidences of successfully forecasting earthquakes.\nAll forecasts must be scientifically reviewed before they are released\n\nResearch projects along the San Andreas Fault aim to improve understanding.\n\nCurrent warning systems provide 15 to 30 seconds of warning and only warn of a major earthquake that has already occurred.', 'Perception of the Earthquake Hazard\nSurvivors of strong earthquakes often report traumatic stress.\nTypically, one community’s experience with an earthquake has not stimulated other communities to enhance their preparedness\n\nEarthquakes have exposed \nshoddy construction practices.', 'Community Adjustments to the Earthquake Hazard\nIt is not possible to prevent people from living in earthquake-prone areas.\n\nTherefore, several steps are necessary to minimize seismic risk:\nCritical facilities should be located as safely as possible\n\n- buildings must be designed to withstand vibrations (retrofitting may be required)', 'Community Adjustments to the Earthquake Hazard\n- education is a component of preparedness (workshops, training sessions, earthquake drills)\nEarthquake insurance should be made available in high-risk areas', 'Personal Adjustments\nMost earthquake casualties result from building collapse and falling objects.\n\nDuring an earthquake, it is best to stay away from windows and tall furniture.\nThe safest locations are under desks or tables'`]]`
